# Floating Point

* There are three floating-point types in C#.
  * Float
    * Floats have a smaller size and less percision.
    * Double (default)
    * Decimal - Super-precise floating-point type. Best for financial transactions.
* To use floats, you must use an "F" suffix in your assignment..

```cs
float myFloat = 12.50F;
```

* To use decimals, you must use an "M" suffix in your assignment.
```cs
decimal myDecimal = 12.50M;
```
