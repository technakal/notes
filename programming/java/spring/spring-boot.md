## Bootstrapping Spring Boot

- You can automatically generate a Spring Boot project using [Spring Initializr](start.spring.io).
  - Here, you select JDK version, Spring Boot version, build tools and dependencies.
  - You set up your main package name, etc.
- Once you have your Spring Boot generated files, Import Project into IntelliJ.
  - Answer the questions in the wizard based on how you set up your initializer files.
- Once imported, it'll download dependencies and get everything ready for you.

## Annotations

- Annotations in Spring Boot wire things up in the background.
  - They speed up development by providing quick configuration shortcuts.
