# GraphQL Basics

- GraphQL is a replacement for REST.
- It's a more expressive querying language that allows us to get (or deliver) exactly the data we want.
- GraphQL is a way of creating intermediate aggregation services for the database payload.
  - Instead of getting the full payload, which REST delivers, you can deliver only the information the particular client needs.
  - With REST, you can accomplish similar functionality through the use of URI parameters, but this is API specific.
    - You can't reuse such a method, and if you're consuming an API, you have to depend on them to build such a method.
